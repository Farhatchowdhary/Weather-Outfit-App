# 🌦️ Weather Outfit App

A simple weather-based outfit suggestion app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Features
- Enter any city name to get mock weather data (no API key required)
- Displays temperature, condition, and outfit suggestion
- Random weather for unknown cities
- Simple and responsive layout

## 🧠 How It Works
The app uses a small set of predefined weather data for major cities like London, Paris, and Tokyo.  
If you enter another city, it generates a random temperature and suggests an outfit accordingly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript

## 📸 Demo
(You can add screenshots here later.)
